# Porting TODO

Upstream gaps and outstanding work. Stage 1 must be green before any Stage 2 item
is started (see [md3-coverage.md](md3-coverage.md)).

## Stage 1 — base modules

All nineteen modules are implemented. What follows is what is *not* finished
inside them, recorded with the question that has to be answered before it can be.

- [x] `MdTokens` — reference / system / component layers, global and per-instance
      override
- [x] `MdColorScheme` — 49 roles, light / dark, including the `*-fixed` family
- [x] `MdTheme` — singleton with the `themeAboutToChange` / `themeChanged` /
      `themeModeChanged` lifecycle
- [x] `MdTypeScale` — 30 styles with script-category line height
- [x] `MdMotion` — easing and duration tokens plus the six Expressive springs
- [x] `MdStateLayer`, `MdRipple`, `MdElevation`, `MdFocusRing`
- [x] `MdIcon` — Material Symbols four axes plus the classic SVG baseline
- [x] `MdResources` — keeps the embedded `.qrc` linked in when the library is a
      static archive
- [x] `MdStyleBase` — `QProxyStyle` base with paint-filter / theme hooks
- [x] `MdFont` + `MdDesign::initialize(&app)`
- [x] Resources under `resources/` + `.qrc` + manifest
- [x] Token-value audit against the published token sources (`TestMd3Tokens`)
- [x] Light / dark render of every colour role (`TestMd3Tokens` compares all 49
      roles in both modes against `_md-sys-color.scss`)
- [x] Fixed-seed dynamic colour against the official implementation
      (`TestMd3Tokens` pins CAM16 against `dart/test/hct_test.dart` and the
      palette tables against `ColorSpec2021`)
- [x] Runnable example gallery under `examples/gallery/`, with `--screenshot`
      for a per-page non-blank render check

### Gaps still open inside Batch 0

- [ ] **`ContrastLevel` is stored but not applied.**
      `MdDynamicScheme::create()` takes standard / medium / high and records it,
      but every role is still resolved from the single published tone table, so
      medium and high currently produce the same output as standard.
      What is needed: a port of `ColorSpec2021`'s `ContrastCurve` and
      `ToneDeltaPair` machinery plus `Contrast.lighter()` / `darker()`, and a
      per-role tone function that takes the contrast level as an input instead
      of reading a constant table. This is the largest remaining piece of Batch
      0 and it is deliberately not stubbed — a half-applied contrast level is
      worse than an honest one.
      Source of truth: `material-color-utilities`
      `java/dynamiccolor/ContrastCurve.java`, `ToneDeltaPair.java`,
      `ColorSpec2021.java`, `java/utils/Contrast.java`.

- [ ] **35 Expressive decorative shape paths.**
      `MdShape::decorativeShapeCount()` returns `0`. The shape scale and shape
      morphing are complete; the decorative path library is not.
      What is needed: the 35 path definitions from the M3 Expressive shape
      library, as normalised paths plus their interpolation pairs. They are not
      in `material-web` (which has no Expressive support) and are not published
      as data anywhere machine-readable, so each one has to be traced from the
      specification and reviewed visually. That is a task of its own, and
      inventing plausible-looking shapes would be worse than having none.

- [ ] **`ScriptCategory::Large` and `ExtraLarge` line-height multipliers.**
      Only `Small` (1.00) and `Medium` (1.07) are sourced from the M3 type
      specification. `Large` and `ExtraLarge` currently fall back to `Medium`'s
      1.07 and are marked as unsourced in the code.
      What is needed: a source that publishes the per-script-category
      multipliers for Devanagari / Bengali / Tamil (large) and Tibetan /
      Mongolian (extra-large).

- [ ] **`ColorSpec2025` and `ColorSpec2026`.**
      The brief names both. `MdDynamicColor` currently implements the
      `ColorSpec2021` palette and tone tables, which is what `material-web`
      v0_192 reproduces and therefore what the token audit can verify. The newer
      specs change several tone assignments (notably around `surface` and the
      tertiary palettes) and need their own tables plus their own audit.

- [ ] **Variable font axes below Qt 6.7.**
      `MdIcon` applies FILL / wght / GRAD / opsz through
      `QFont::setVariableAxis`, which is Qt 6.7+. On Qt 6.5 and 6.6
      `MdIcon::axesSupported()` returns false and only the named weights are
      honoured. The declared minimum stays at 6.5.0, so this is a documented
      capability difference rather than a bug.

## Stage 1 — components

Not started. Track progress in [md3-coverage.md](md3-coverage.md). Order follows
the official categories: Actions → Communication → Containment → Navigation →
Selection → Text inputs, then the M3 Expressive cross-cutting pass.

## Stage 2 — Qt extensions

Not started. Full list: appendix D of
[md3-qt-porting-prompts.md](md3-qt-porting-prompts.md). Blocked by the
`TestMd3CoveragePolicy` gate until Stage 1 is green.
